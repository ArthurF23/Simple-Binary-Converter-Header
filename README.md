# Simple-Binary-Converter-Header
A simple converter header that can convert ascii to binary or hex or any combination of those...

Use ```std::Converter::CONVERT((enum)TYPE::{type of conversion}, input_string);``` to convert anything.

More types of conversions will be added but it is very easy to add more definitions/translations to the header... It is very simple!
